## Hello, Loopers!

This isn't just any tavern—it's a cornerstone of community and exploration, a place where every Looper can find something special.

## The Guilded Gryphon: Your Safe Haven
The Guilded Gryphon is more than a cozy stop; it's a beacon for adventurers. Our four unique units are not only a place to unwind but also a key part of your journey.

- **Save Your Adventures:** Each unit doubles as a personal save point. After your day’s adventures, find solace in knowing your progress is safely tucked away.
- **Portals to Chosen Destinations:** The tavern houses two portals, their destinations to be decided. The best part? As an owner of a room, you'll have a say in where these portals lead. Together, we'll unlock new adventures.
