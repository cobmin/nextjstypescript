## Create Your Sprites
![Creating Sprites](/assets/blog/Bring-Pixel-Art-to-Life/Aseprite.png)
Creating sprites is a cornerstone of bringing your pixel art to life in LooperLands. I personally use Aseprite for its effectiveness in pixel art creation and sprite management. However, the community uses a diverse range of tools, and I've listed some popular alternatives below for you to explore.
### **Choosing Your Software**
- **Pixel Art Specific Tools:**
  - Aseprite (purchase): My personal favorite, offering robust features for pixel art. Visit [www.aseprite.org](https://www.aseprite.org/).
  - PixelStudio (free): A versatile tool for Android and Apple users. Ideal for crafting pixel art on the go. [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PixelStudio&pli=1) | [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixel-studio-for-pixel-art/id1404203859).
- **General Tools:**
  - [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/): Great for final touches and scaling item graphics with precision.
  - [EZGIF Sprite Cutter](https://ezgif.com/sprite-cutter): A diverse set of tools that's useful for various sprite creation needs.

### **Previewing Your Sprites**
![Creating Sprites](/assets/blog/Bring-Pixel-Art-to-Life/SpriteSheetHelper.gif)
Once your sprites are ready, see them in motion:
- **Test Your Sprites:** Easily upload your .png files [here](https://loopworms.io/DEV/LooperLands/sprites/) to view your sprites from all angles and see how they look in action.

### **Tutorials** 
Need some guidance? Here are my go-to resources:
- [PixelArt Tutorials](https://www.pixilart.com/tutorials): A treasure trove of information for pixel art enthusiasts. 
- [AdamCYounis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLdxW--S_0h4dlWUpl-TzBp-ulqK3NiM_): My personal favorite for in-depth pixel art tutorials.

## Single Uploads
For those who are interested in a simpler process of creating and uploading a single sprite to LooperLands, I recommend starting at Step 4 in the [Creators-101](https://discord.gg/DntWrUD3nq) guide on Discord. This method is ideal if you're starting out or prefer to focus on single creations.

- **Step 4 in Creators-101:** Perfect for single sprite creations and uploads.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplified process compared to bulk uploads, ideal for beginners.

The information below, however, is tailored towards those looking to create and upload multiple sprites at once, including making unique 1/1s or generating a variety of sprites.

![Using Maize](/assets/blog/Bring-Pixel-Art-to-Life/Maize.png)
## For BulkUploads: Setting Up Your Sprites in Files
Once your sprites are crafted, it's time to bring them into the LooperLands universe. Maize plays a crucial role here, facilitating the generation of profile pictures (PFPs), metadata for minting, and preparing bulk uploads to LooperLands.

- Folder Structure: Organize your sprite files in folders as per Maize's requirements. This structure is key in determining your NFT's metadata. For detailed guidance, check out the [Maize Documentation](https://maizehelps.art/docs/tutorials/one-of-one-creation/generate-one-of-one-loopers#folder-and-file-setup).

## Generating Your Assets

### **Using Maize for Generation**
Maize is a versatile console application that streamlines the creation and integration of your sprites into LooperLands.
- **Multiple Options:** Whether you're looking to create a series of similar 1/1s or a range of diverse 1/1s, Maize offers the flexibility needed for your creative vision.
- **Creating Sprites and NFTs:** Maize assists in generating sprites, NFTs, metadata, and the necessary bulk upload files for LooperLands.
- **From NFTs to Sprites:** If you have pre-minted NFTs, Maize can help convert these into sprites, with metadata properties set up as key-value pairs.

For more insights into Maize's capabilities and how to use it, refer to the [documentation](https://maizehelps.art/docs/tutorials/one-of-one-creation/generate-one-of-one-loopers).

## Minting Your NFTs with Maize
Before you can upload your assets to LooperLands, you need to mint them as NFTs. This crucial step turns your digital creations into unique, tradeable assets within the blockchain ecosystem.

- **Minting with Maize:** Maize simplifies the minting process. It generates your NFTs from the sprites and metadata you've created. For a detailed guide on minting with Maize, visit their minting tutorial.
- **Ready for Upload:** Once minted, your NFTs are ready to be part of the bulk upload process to LooperLands.

## Uploading to LooperLands

### **Utilizing Discord for Upload**
Once Maize has generated your PFPs, metadata, and minted your NFTs, it compiles all necessary files into a ZIP file for bulk upload.
- **BulkUploadFolder:** After generation, you'll receive a ZIP file containing everything needed for a bulk upload to LooperLands.
- **Step-by-Step Upload Process:** A readme file is included in the ZIP with detailed steps for the upload process. Follow these instructions in our Discord community to seamlessly upload your creations to LooperLands.
- **Asset Submission Fee:** Once your asset is submitted, send the asset submission fee to looperlands.loopring.eth.
- **Transaction Confirmation:** Post a picture of your transaction in the ⁠looperlands-order-submissions channel on Discord.
- **Queue and Merging:** Submissions are typically merged into the game around 8 AM EST each morning. You can view submissions currently in the queue [here](https://loopworms.io/DEV/LooperLands/AddNewLooper/CreatorReportFile.html).

By following these steps and utilizing Maize's capabilities, you can efficiently integrate your creative works into the LooperLands ecosystem, enriching the game with your unique artistic contributions.

## Engaging Your Community
Building a strong community is key to the success of any creator in LooperLands. One effective way to engage your audience and show appreciation is through airdropping NFTs.

### Airdropping NFTs with Maize
- **Find Your Item Holders:** Discover who owns your creations using Maize. This tool helps you identify the holders of your LooperLands items, making it easier to target your airdrops effectively. For more details, check out the [Holders from NFT Data tutorial](https://maizehelps.art/docs/tutorials/lookups/holders-from-nft-data).
- **Reward Your Community:** Strengthen your connection with the community by airdropping NFTs to your item holders. This gesture not only rewards their loyalty but also increases the value of your creations. Learn how to airdrop NFTs with Maize [here](https://maizehelps.art/docs/tutorials/airdrops/nfts-to-users).

Airdropping NFTs allows you to keep your community engaged and excited about your work. It's a powerful tool to acknowledge their support and encourage further interaction with your creations.
