## What is Cob's Farm?

Cob's Farm is not just another game; it's a labor of love and a reflection of my own interests and gaming adventures. Imagine a world where the tranquil, community-focused life of Animal Crossing intersects with the intense, combat-filled realm of Diablo. That's the magic we're creating with Cob's Farm. Whether you're strolling through vibrant farms, admiring nature, interacting with animated farm animals, or defeating monsters in perilous dungeons, this game offers something for everyone.

## Cob's Farm in the Looper Lands Universe
![Cob's Farm in Looper Lands](/assets/blog/Discover-Cobs-Farm/LooperLandsEntrance.jpg)
Cob's Farm is a unique realm within the expansive world of [Looper Lands](https://loopworms.io/DEV/LooperLands/LooperLandsGuide/). To participate in the Alpha Fields phase, you'll need a [CobLooper](https://loopexchange.art/collection/cobsfarm). Once you own one, your wallet can access Alpha Fields with any Looper, as long as a CobLooper is in the same wallet.

Once you've acquired a CobLooper, head to the hillside house located on the middle-south side of Looper Lands' main city to find the portal to Cob's Farm. Look for the house in the above screenshot.

## Welcome to Alpha Fields

Alpha Fields is the first stage of our unfolding adventure. This foundational stage serves as a proving ground where we fine-tune gameplay dynamics, implement player feedback, and roll out new features. If you're looking forward to farming, fishing, owning shops, and having your own house, know that these enriching experiences are on our roadmap.

### Labor Day Drop Success and What's Next 

We're beyond excited to share the latest updates on Cob's Farm: Alpha Fields. Our [Labor Day drop](https://loopexchange.art/collection/cobsfarm) was a resounding success, with all 12 characters selling out at 80 LRC each â€” some even being resold for as high as 169 LRC! With such enthusiasm propelling us forward, we're thrilled to unveil our next major milestone: the Alpha Origin Airdrop.

## The Alpha Origin Airdrop: Mystic Maize Vault

Step into the next phase of Cob's Farm with the Alpha Origin Airdrop, featuring our latest innovation, the [Mystic Maize Vault](https://loopexchange.art/collection/cobsfarm/item/0xad3fb206e6779cc882fa733394b67d8b8a4f6710920cea161909bb4a71086883). Unlike our previous releases that featured pre-designed characters, this 180 LRC token introduces an element of serendipity. Each Mystic Maize Vault holds a randomized CobLooper character equipped with either an axe or a sword. The range of traits varies in rarity, infusing the drop with an element of excitement and unpredictability.

## Key Dates and Logistics

- **Airdrop Event**: 9/17/2023 at 7:41 PM EST

Mystic Maize Vaults will be available starting on 9/10 at 7:41 PM EST. The airdrop event is scheduled for 9/17 at 7:41 PM EST. Should all tokens sell out before this date, the airdrop will be expedited. Any remaining unsold tokens will be burned after 9/17 at 7:41 PM EST.

### The Spectrum of Traits: A World of Possibilities
Your Mystic Maize Vault contains characters and weapons imbued with a range of traits, adding an element of thrill and surprise to the game. You can view some of the current traits from the Labor Day series.
