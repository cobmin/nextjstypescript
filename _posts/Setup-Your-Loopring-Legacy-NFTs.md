Prior to the ability to create multiple collections on Loopring, users were limited to one collection per wallet. Any NFTs created under this single collection are now considered to be legacy NFTs. If you have noticed NFTs in the Loopring ecosystem not displaying correctly, it may be because they are legacy NFTs that have not yet been associated with a new collection. Fortunately, there is a solution.

## How to Set Up Your Legacy NFTs

Although Loopring makes this process straightforward, I've provided a quick how-to below for visual learners.
## Steps

1. Log in to [Loopring.io](https://loopring.io) with your wallet that holds the Legacy NFTs.
2. Navigate to the L2 NFT > My Collections > Import Collection For Legacy NFT.
